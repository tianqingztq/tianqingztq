### HiðŸ‘‹
### I am Tianqing Zhou, 
### QMSS 22', Columbia University

Academically, my Master's degree program  provides a rigorous foundation in Statistics and Python/R programming & engineering. 

Besides, I am experienced in data science & analysis with a demonstrated history of working in my past internship at large companies like DiDi (Uber China), Tencent, and Alibaba. As a data scientist, I successfully used my technical skills to create business value.

ðŸ‘¯ Eagerly looking forward to new-graduate openings in the US. Excited to help businesses grow, and spark science-based and data-oriented change!
